# firstGroupProject

We created this app to gather many tools a Dungeons and Dragons dungeon master can utilize when hosting a game of D&D. The main tool is a spell tool that can help you search for spell description, roll die, and keep track of die count. We also implemented a meetup tool that can connect you to other players via Google Firebase and Maps.
